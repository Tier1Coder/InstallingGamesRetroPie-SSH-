# InstallingGamesRetroPie-SSH-


Hello. In this repository we will learn how to move files from a PC Raspberry Pi (I'm using Raspberry 4 actually) and especially make it work with RetroPie Retro-games emulator.
You can see the photos for more details.

1) Enable SSH port on your Raspberry Pi. Go to the:  "raspi-config" in terminal or select it from desktop:
 (preferences -> raspberry pi configuration -> interfaces -> SSH -> ENABLE
2) Download FileZilla -> https://filezilla-project.org/
3) Open it.
4) Open Site Manager (left top)
5) Put the Host adres and username. Then connect. If your Raspberry Pi has a password you have to type it down. Once that, you will be connected.

You can get the "Host" adress after pointing the Wi-Fi Icon on your RPI's desktop.

6) Now all you have to do is select the proper folder (left side) from your PC that you want to move to your raspberry (right side).
Remember to refresh if you want to be up-to-date.

Move to:
RetroPie -> roms -> choose the right station (for example N64 - Nintendo 64)

7) Drag the folder.

That's all ! :)
